## what was used

HTML and CSS

## what I learned

- this search bar floating above the image was my biggest difficulty, so I was very happy when I was able to solve it
- this time I tested using 'em' instead of 'px' to understand how it works

> 🍒 something I plan to change in the future is to adapt to mobile
